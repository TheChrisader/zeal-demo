        Who Told Your Story? Let’s Start There.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most African headlines come wrapped in pity, panic, or propaganda. At
        ZealNews Africa, we said: <strong>Enough.</strong>
        We’re here to tell our stories our way — complex, colourful, and
        unapologetically African. No parachute journalism. No filter. Just raw,
        refined, radical storytelling for a continent that refuses to be boxed.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-is-zealnews-africa">What Is ZealNews Africa?</h3>
      <p>
        We’re not your regular news site. We’re a{" "}
        <strong>media-tech engine</strong> , a <strong>content lab</strong> ,
        and a <strong>cultural amplifier</strong> rolled into one.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We <strong>curate what matters.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          We <strong>create what’s missing.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          We <strong>champion what’s been silenced.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From the underground churches of Lalibela to the startup streets of
        Yaba, we hunt down the stories others overlook — then tell them with
        fire, depth, and dignity.
        <strong>We don’t break news. We break it open.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We question the dominant narrative.</li>
        <li>We explain complex issues without dumbing them down.</li>
        <li>We platform voices that were never meant to whisper.</li>
        <li>We connect the dots between Africa and the Diaspora.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You’ll find us everywhere: In long reads and short reels, in
        infographics and footnotes, in opinion columns and deep dives. We speak
        Gen Z. We speak Grandma. <strong>We speak us.</strong>

        African experience, both on the continent and in the diaspora. Through
        ZealNews and her op-eds, Maureen champions a bold, context-rich approach
        to news — one that centers young voices, reclaims forgotten histories,
        and challenges oversimplified narratives. Her work focuses on{" "}
